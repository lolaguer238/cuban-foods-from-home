## About the Collection

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

This site will function as an oral history of those in my family elaborating on the background behind meals taught to them along with instructions for cooking. It is both a depository of this history and actual recipes, so other family members may be able to prepare them and appreciate the background given as a means for conservation. This includes when it was first taught to the individual who taught me, and referencing original ingredients initially used for certain meals. I thought this would be useful for future reference, since my mother usually does not write her recipes down. I do not want to lose this valuable information but instead ensure its vitality. 

The content of this site is currently 14 audio recordings of specific recipes with 14 photographs to accompany them. The condition for these photos are satisfactory since they are taken through a phone, meant to capture the look of the meal right after being cooked. Each audio recording contains ingredients, directions, and cultural relations to the specific dish. Each photograph contains a visual description of what is depicted. Potential users of source can be Cuban family members interested in recreating these dishes. This could be personal family members or those who stumble upon this site. There can also be other Cubans or non-Cubans that would like to try this cuisine and expand their skills in the kitchen. This collection is not a full guide of Cuban cuisine but is a good start to basics to be.
